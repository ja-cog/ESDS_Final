Problem 1: Analyzing Seed Count Variation in Kangaroo Rat Mound Locations
Description
The goal of this analysis is to investigate the differences in total seed count between various kangaroo rat mound locations. The code loads and cleans the data, checks for missing values, states the null and alternative hypotheses, creates a model object, performs a histogram analysis to check the distribution, conducts Levene's test for homogeneity of variances, summarizes the model, and finally, performs a Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test and creates a data visualization.

Problem 2: Analyzing the Relationship between Seed Count and Predictor Variables in Shrub Studies
Description
The objective of this analysis is to explore the relationship between seed count and several predictor variables, including plot type, plant species, and total number of inflorescences, in shrub studies. The code loads and cleans the necessary data files, checks for missing values, states the null and alternative hypotheses, performs histogram analyses to check the normality of variables, conducts Levene's test for homogeneity of variances, runs a multiple linear regression analysis, and creates various data visualizations.
